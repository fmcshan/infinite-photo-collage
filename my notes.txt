Initialization:
* for all files in "images" folder, calc average color then map as <avgColor,localpath>

Zooming method (level 0):
* original image stored (BufferedImage) and referenced for pixel colors
* image object does not get replaced by repainted panel
* resized image gets rendered pixel by pixel with new side length
* after some pixel length threshold is passed, the visible pixel areas get replaced by new images

Replacing pixel area(s) with images:
* 
* replacement threshold will prob not match resolution of new images
  - if resolution > threshold, should not render pixel by pixel
  - if resolution < threshold, try to render pixel by pixel to next closest size (round up)
* storing set of images in collage
  - 2d array of filenames, image objs, or something else?
