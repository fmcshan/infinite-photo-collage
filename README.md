# Infinite Photo Collage
Contributors: Liliana Foucault, Frank McShan, Molly Sunray

Begin by selecting a directory of images from your file system. Once a directory has been selected, a random image from that directory will appear in a new window.

You can zoom in on the image by pressing the spacebar, scrolling on a trackpad, or using a mouse wheel. You can also use the autoplay feature to automate this by clicking the “Play” button. The “Pause” button can then be clicked to stop autoplay.

After a certain threshold, the image will be replaced by a collage of smaller images that collectively resemble the original image.

You can continue zooming in on the collage, and after the threshold, it too will be replaced with another collage of smaller images. This process can repeat infinitely.
