### How to run
Open this project folder in a terminal and run the following:
```
javac src/ImageZoom.java
java src/ImageZoom
```
You will then be prompted for the name of the starting image. You must include the directory name at the beginning (if any) and image type at the end of the name (eg. ".jpg", ".png", etc.). An example could be `images/cat_0001.jpg`.

### How to use
To zoom in, you may use a mouse or trackpad. To pan, you may use the bottom and righthand scroll bars. A panel with debug information will be in the top left corner of the window.
